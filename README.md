Paper abstract: This article elaborate on the kinematic and dynamic analysis of ARASH:ASiST, ”ARAS Haptic System for Eye Surgery Training”, which is developed for vitrectomy eye surgery training. The mechanism selection of this system is reviewed first, in order to assist such a precise intraocular eye surgery training. Then the kinematics and dynamics analysis of the proposed haptic system is investigated. To verify the reported result, a prototype of ARASH:ASiST is modeled in MSC-ADAMS , and the results of the dynamic formulation are validated. Finally, a common model-based controller is implemented on the real prototype, and it is verified that with such controller a suitable accuracy of 200 μm is attainable for the surgical instrument.
